# 🎵 MERN Music Player

A full-stack **music player web application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  
This project focuses on implementing a functional frontend UI backed by a Node/Express API and MongoDB database.

The goal of this project is to practice real-world full-stack development concepts, including component-based UI design, API integration, and project structuring.
